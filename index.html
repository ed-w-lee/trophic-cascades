        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            When we eat fish, what impact does that have on the environment?
        </p>
        <p>
            With other meats like beef and pork, we tend to focus on things like the greenhouse gas emissions from cow
            farts and the added nutrients in their surroundings due to animal waste, which are all really important.
        </p>
        <p>
            But unlike cows, pigs, and chickens, fish aren't all raised in ranches.
            Around 50% of the world's fish supply comes from fisheries taking these fish out of the oceans and the seas for us to consume.
            In the ocean, fish interact with other species, like whales, and sharks, and other fish.
            As such, there's an additional factor we need to think about:
            How does the removal of fish affect the ecosystem it was taken from?
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned before, fish might interact with many different species, and with all these connections it's hard to know where to begin.
            One way we can attempt to start, and what we're going to do here, is think about the "who-eats-who" relationships.
            And to do so, we're going to construct an <b>ecological network</b>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>A single step</h2>
        <iframe src="sim/sim.html?mode=single" scrolling="no" class="demo"></iframe>
        <p>
            As seen here, in our ecological network, each species is represented as a point in space, a <b>node</b>.
            In this case, we've got sea urchins represented.
        </p>
        <p>
            This node represents how many species there are with the solid red inner circle, and how many there can be with the outer circle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try adding and removing sea urchins from our node above. (Don't worry too much about the 'play' and 'reset' buttons.)
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>A link is born</h2>
        <p>
            So we can add or remove sea urchins, but currently that's not really super interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, there are some species that interact with sea urchins, like sea otters which eat urchins.
            Let's add a new node for sea otters as well as a <b>link</b> connecting the two species to represent their interaction.
        </p>
        <iframe src="sim/sim.html?mode=double" scrolling="no" class="demo"></iframe>
        <p>
            Now try adding and removing mass from the urchin population and see what happens. (Press 'play' to see the interaction in action!)
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are a few things to note:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <b>impacts</b> that go across the link change sizes as they move from urchin to otter and back for the same reason.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Red impacts <b class="red">decrease</b> the population, and green impacts <b class="green">increase</b> them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the sea urchin population <b class="green">increases</b>, the sea otter population changes with it since more urchins can support more otters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the other hand, when the otter population <b class="green">increases</b>, urchin population <b class="red">decreases</b> as more otters can eat more urchins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since each sea otter needs to eat multiple sea urchins, the possible size for the sea otter node is <i>smaller</i> than that of the urchin node.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Changes in population go back and forth between the sea urchins and sea otters.
                </li>

            </ul>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>It all comes tumbling down</h2>
        <p>
            With nodes and links, we can begin to understand how removing fish affects the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's add yet another node to the current network, this time what urchin eat: kelp.
        </p>
        <iframe src="sim/sim.html?mode=chain" scrolling="no" class="demo"></iframe>
        <p>
            Try adding or removing mass from the kelp population, and see how the urchin and sea otter communities change. Not much, right?
            Now try adding or removing mass from the sea otter population. Note how much larger the change is here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why did populations react differently when we removed the same amount from both populations?
        </p>
        <p>
            You likely guessed it, but it's because otters eat many urchins and urchins eat many kelp.
            So when some otters get removed, that many more urchins can eat that much more kelp.
            And in kelp forests, this can mean the difference between a lush kelp forest filled with all sorts of fish or an urchin barren of nothing but sea urchins.
        </p>
        <p>
            This amplification of effects, from otter to urchin to kelp, is what's known as a <b>trophic cascade</b>.
            Changes in the population high up in a network can have cascading effects that ripple down to the bottom, ultimately changing the environment and the species composition of the ecosystem.
            These cascades are often really undesirable because they can cause catastrophic changes to an ecosystem and alter it until it's unrecognizable without changing too much.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>The <i>Pisaster</i> Disaster</h2>
        <p>
            Other than changing kelp forests, what else can trophic cascades have an effect on?
            In this case, we'll see how changing populations high up in a network can change the diversity of the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the tide pools, organisms like mussels, barnacles, and limpets that attach themselves to the rocks compete for space against one another.
            Mussels can often beat out its competitors for space on the rocks, but are also the primary food item for the sea star <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our network currently, mussels take up more space than the other species. 
            Can you make the species composition more balanced by <b>only adjusting sea star populations?</b>
        </p>
        <iframe src="sim/sim.html?mode=diverse" scrolling="no" class="demo"></iframe>
        <p>
            As you might have done yourself, by increasing sea star populations, mussels get eaten more often, allowing more space for the other 3 species to grow.
            On the other hand, eradicating sea stars would cause mussel populations to shoot up and prevent other species from taking hold.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a huge problem facing coastal ecosystems across North America due to <i>sea star wasting disease</i>, which has decimated sea star populations in recent years.
            This severe decline in sea star populations thus not only means loss of sea stars, but likely also severe reductions of other organisms in the tide-pool that are outcompeted by mussels.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Resisting change</h2>
        <p>
            So we've seen the potential for trophic cascades.
            But do all networks necessarily have cascades?
            And is there any way we can take species higher up in a network without unintentionally triggering one?
        </p>
        <p>
            We can look to coral reefs as an indication.
            In coral reefs, there is a constant battle between coral and algae.
            Herbivorous fish like parrotfish and rabbitfish can help corals by consuming algae before it covers the surface.
            However, we humans also eat a lot of reef fish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try exterminating different species and see how much the coral population changes.
        </p>
        <iframe src="sim/sim.html?mode=robust" scrolling="no" class="demo"></iframe>
        <p>
            If we exterminate just a single species of fish, we can see that the coral population doesn't change too much.
            It might be hard to track, but this may be due to the other 2 untouched fish species, which are able to fill in for the exterminated species.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, as we continue to remove more fish species, note that the remaining fish species are less and less capable of filling in, with coral populations getting smaller and smaller.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, changing human demand immediately has a cascading effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            The difference between these fish species and humans is that the fish, being more diverse, have more opportunities for picking up the slack of others.
            If one species goes extinct, the others can still keep algae populations low.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Connecting it all together</h2>
        <p>
            So that's it.
            Not all species removed have equal impact.
            Consuming fish has lower impact on the ecosystem when these fish are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    located lower in the food web,
                </li>
                <li>
                    have similar species that serve similar functions,
                </li>
                <li>
                    and aren't the sole connection to another species
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, there are other factors we ignored here.
            A lot, actually.
            Networks can change based on behavior or population dynamics.
            Different fish take different resources to fish or raise.
            Fishing by dragging nets at the bottom of the seafloor can damage fish's homes and their ability to find mates.
            We're taking small fish by the boatload, which could have just as much impact as fishing for larger predators.
        </p>
        <p>
            But as an oversimplified rule of thumb, to have the least impact on ecosystems, and to prevent unwanted trophic cascades, <b>eat small, eat low</b>.

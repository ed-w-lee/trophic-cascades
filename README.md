# Trophic Cascades
Small website explaining trophic cascades (hopefully...)

Go play around with it over [here](https://ed-w-lee.github.io/trophic-cascades/)

## Disclaimer
This was done in 1 tea-filled night. So, not the greatest of code, nor the best of models.
Honestly, ecological networks are much more complex than this article makes it out to be, and this is my attempt at doing some sort of approximation honoring a bunch of the stuff we learned in my Marine Conservation Biology class.

Also, it's been a while since I last touched HTML/CSS/Javascript and my first time working with D3, so please don't judge my code too harshly. I know it's really inefficient.
